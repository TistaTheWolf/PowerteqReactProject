# PowerteqReactProject
Branch this repo, add the functionality and push your branch
DO NOT COMMIT ON MAIN AND PUSH!
Instead, make a new branch with its base on main, and then commit and push that branch. Your branch should be something like firstname-lastname. Push that branch when you have reached the end goal.
You can see an example of what your front end code should look like at: https://wardmorg.org


# Download Git
from here: https://git-scm.com/
then from the command prompt/terminal: git clone https://github.com/wardmo/PowerteqReactProject.git

You can also download the main zip and start from there, but the end branch should be pushed to the repository to demonstrate git comptency.
